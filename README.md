How It Works
Frontend (Client-Side):

The user interface where people send and receive messages.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Communicates with the server to send and receive messages in real-time.
Backend (Server-Side):

Manages message data and user connections.
Built using frameworks like Node.js (with Socket.IO for real-time communication).
Stores chat history and user data in a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
Database:

Stores user credentials, chat history, and session data.
Used to retrieve and persist messages and user information.
Real-Time Communication:

WebSocket protocol (using libraries like Socket.IO) enables real-time message exchange between clients.

Use Git for version control.
Frontend Development:

Create a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Use frameworks like React.js for dynamic components if needed.
Backend Development:

Use Node.js with Express to handle requests and routes.
Integrate Socket.IO for real-time communication.
Database Setup:

Set up MongoDB or another database.
